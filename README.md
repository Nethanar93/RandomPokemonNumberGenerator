# RandomPokemonNumberGenerator
A simple random number generator for pokemon numbers , with the choice of individual generations or all-in-one.

I'm a programmer who likes to draw and pokemon, so what's better than combining all three?
The idea of this program is to get the number of a random pokémon and then draw that pokémon.
