# RandomPokemonNumberGenerator
A simple random number generator for pokemon numbers , with the choice of individual generations or all-in-one.

I'm a programmer who likes to draw and pokemon, so what's better than combining all three?
The idea of this program is to get the number of a random pokémon and then draw that pokémon.

Includes a .exe file, using py2exe, which needs to be installed manually, but the program can of course be run using a python interpreter.

The program is finnished as it is, but editions and additions may come.
